let updates = [
    "Clicker automatically remembers and reattaches to the app last targeted before it closed. This means that if your client/browser is open before you pen Clicker, it will find the application target, and attach to it automagically :)",
    "Relocated hotkey/shortcut recorders to designated preferences pane. This can be access by either pressing (âŒ˜,) or can be found in the menu under the pp name next to the ï£¿ in the top left. Any menu item can be searched for using the menu help search function.",
    "You can now set hotkeys without any modifier keys (âŒƒâŒ¥â‡§âŒ˜). This allows much simpler toggling especially if mining mid air. Default hotkeys are not set, but this can be changed in settings.",
    "Added a mouse clicker, set up a keyboard shortcut to activate it in settings.",
    "Clicker now has an official App Icon ðŸ¥³",
    "Fixed bug where application would open in an ugly huge size, and removed application tabbing.",
    "Fixed many bugs with hotkeys not working.",
    "Fixed bug where changing keys to press textbox would still click the old payload.",
    "Fixed bug where typing in delay boxes would still sometimes toggle the clicker.",
    "Fixed crashing when receiving 'Selected app not running' alert and then selecting a different app.",
    "General stability improvements."
